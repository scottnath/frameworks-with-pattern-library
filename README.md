Using [Pattern Library](http://github.com/pattern-library/pattern-library) html patterns in javascript frameworks
---

My work is currently testing out various front-end javascript frameworks. These include Angular, Backbone Marionette, Ember, and React (which is not a framework, but why not test it?) The testing includes pulling in an external rest service and using that data to make a page for that data.

Because we're working to create a common HTML pattern library (see the [Pattern Library](http://github.com/pattern-library/pattern-library) project), I wanted to support our framework-testing efforts by making sure that we have a way to use our patterns within these systems.
